/****************** Usage: For finding the real roots of any given Transcendental equation. ****************************/

/********************* Specification: The program takes coeffients of the equation and upper and lower values of the interval as the input and computes the root for the given equation using Regular-falsi's method ***********************/

/*************** Given Equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0**************/
/*************** Roots is: Depends on the Equation ***************/

/* The bisection method guarantees that the iterative process will converge. It is,
however, slow. Thus, attempts have been made to speed up** the bisection
method retaining its guaranteed convergence. A method of doing this is called
the method of false position.
It is sometimes known as the method of linear interpolation.
This is the oldest method for finding the real roots of a numerical equation
and closely resembles the bisection method.
In this method, we choose two points x0 and x1 such that f(x0) and f(x1) are
of opposite signs. Since the graph of y = f(x) crosses the X-axis between these
two points, a root must lie in between these points.
Consequently, f(x0) f(x1) < 0

The equation of the chord joining points {x0, f(x0)} and {x1, f(x1)} is

         y â€“ f(x0) = (f(x1)-f(x0)/x1-x0)(x-x0)

The method consists in replacing the curve AB by means of the chord AB
and taking the point of intersection of the chord with the X-axis as an
approximation to the root.
So the abscissa of the point where the chord cuts y = 0 is given by

         x2 = x0 - (x1-x0)f(x0)/(f(x1)-f(x0))

which is an approximation to the root.
If f(x0) and f(x2) are now of opposite signs, then the root lies between x0 and
x2. So replacing x1 with x2 in (7), we obtain the next approximation, x3. However,
the root could also lie between x1 and x2 and then we find x3 accordingly.
This procedure is repeated until the root is found to the desired accuracy. */
